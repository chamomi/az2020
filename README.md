Application of Sutherland-Hodgman to problem of finding if two polygons intersect.

Application looks for file input.txt in the current folder to read the input data (one polygon per line). In input file coordinates are separated by comma and points are separated by semicolon (;). Points are given in counter-clockwise order.

Folder "output" contains executable application with example input file (same as input_false.txt in main folder)
